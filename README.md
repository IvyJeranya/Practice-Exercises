This repository contains a series of practice exercises I’ve completed as part of my self-taught journey in development. These exercises are based on tasks provided by my school (a one-year program), but the solutions are my own work. They focus on building foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the goal of creating interactive and functional web applications. Although I have been working mainly on the frontend, I do have some skills in fundamental databases and node.js and I aim to expand my knowledge into backend development as I progress.

These exercises have allowed me to practice key development concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with arrays and objects in JavaScript. I’m excited to continue learning and building on this foundation as I explore more areas of development.

Feel free to explore these exercises, and don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback! Although I’m still a beginner, I believe that sparring and helping other beginners is a great way to learn, so feel free to ask anything. I’m always open to discussions and would love to learn and grow together with others!<3
