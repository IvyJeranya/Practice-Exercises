This repository contains a series of practice exercises I’ve completed as part of my self-taught journey in development. These exercises are based on tasks provided by my school (a one-year program), but the solutions are my own work. They focus on building foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the goal of creating interactive and functional web applications. Although I have been working mainly on the frontend, I aim to expand my knowledge into backend development as I progress.

Box Resizing with Buttons (Exercise 1): A simple webpage where users can resize two boxes using buttons. The boxes' width changes on button clicks, and their color is adjusted based on the size (white, orange, or red). A counter tracks the total number of clicks.

Interactive Cat Game (Exercise 2): A small interactive game where the user can move a cat (named Miaow Miaow) around the screen using buttons. It also includes a dialogue feature where the cat "talks" to a fish if it reaches a specific area, with questions and responses selected randomly from an array.

Country Information and Population (Exercise 3): A project that displays country information for countries in the Americas. It includes functionality for filtering countries by subregion, displaying population data, and finding the countries with the highest and lowest populations.

These exercises have allowed me to practice key development concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and working with arrays and objects in JavaScript. I’m excited to continue learning and building on this foundation as I explore more areas of development.

Feel free to explore these exercises, and don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions or feedback! Although I’m still a beginner, I believe that sparring and helping other beginners is a great way to learn, so feel free to ask anything. I’m always open to discussions and would love to learn and grow together with others!<3
