This interactive web-based game allows users to move characters (Robot, Arno, and Aldo) to specific boxes on the screen by entering the desired box name. 
The game checks if the characters are placed in their correct positions, providing feedback on the move. The goal is to move each character to its designated box, 
and once all characters are correctly placed, the game congratulates the user. This project demonstrates the use of user input, dynamic positioning, and condition 
checking in JavaScript.
