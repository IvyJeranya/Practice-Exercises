This interactive web game simulates a money and cookie buying system. The user can click buttons to generate money, buy cookies (one or two at a time), 
and view a purchase log. Each action updates the user's total money, cookies, and the associated visuals of money and cookies. The game features a simple 
user interface with dynamic elements like images and buttons, allowing users to interact and track their progress in a fun and engaging way. This project 
demonstrates how to manage user interactions, handle updates, and display results dynamically using JavaScript.
